# Description:  This script will moitor for and shutdown webservers that have become unresponsive
# It also persistently adds the ip addresses of machines that it considers to be online to the dns
# service provider. You might think, why add an ip address when it is already added which is mostly what
# this does, but, on occassion, I have seen correct code fail to add an ip address to a DNS provider for
# some reason unknown, so, if we keep adding it we know that whenever there is a machine avaiable and online
# we will do our utmost as soon as we can to have its ip active on the DNS service provider.
# Hence, the name of the script. If an ip addresses is found to be dead and unresposive, for some reason,
# it is removed from th DNS service provider. If it is found to be alive and well, it is added to the dns
# service provider.
